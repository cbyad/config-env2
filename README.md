# ENV2 (WIP)
## About
`env2` stands for en**V**ironment **V**alidator. A tiny library to validate environment variables at runtime and extract content.

It's backed by [fp-ts](https://github.com/gcanti/fp-ts) for functional prog utilities and [io-ts](https://github.com/gcanti/io-ts) for runtime validation and define custom types.
For those who are unfamiliar with functional programming **No Worries** you need to only import `npm i io-ts` and follow `example` supplied
